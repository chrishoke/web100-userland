Software Required
=================

    The following software is required to make a release:

- autoconf
- automake
- libtool
- GTK+
- GTK+ development tools (headers and M4)
- doctext (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~gropp/manuals/doctext/doctext.html)

How To Make A Release
=====================

- In configure.in, change VERSION to be the appropriate web100 package
  version string.  Note: This is not the major/minor/micro version on
  libweb100 (see next).
- Update the libweb100 version in configure.in: Pick _one_ of the following,
  starting from the top:
  1. If any libweb100 interfaces have been removed since the last release:
     LT_CURRENT += 1
     LT_REVISION = 0
     LT_AGE = 0
  2. If any libweb100 interfaces have been changed since the last release:
     LT_CURRENT += 1
     LT_REVISION = 0
  3. If any libweb100 interfaces have been added since the last release:
     LT_CURRENT += 1
     LT_REVISION = 0
     LT_AGE += 1
  4. If the source code has changed but the interfaces have not since the
     last release:
     LT_REVISION += 1
- Make sure all documentation is up-to-date.  This includes:
  AUTHORS
  COPYING
  INSTALL
  NEWS
  README (including version number at top)
  Automatically generated man pages within libweb100 source code
  doc/developers-guide.txt
  doc/users-guide.txt
  Handwritten man pages in doc/man
  The 'Latest Release' section of the documents part of the web page
  ... and possibly others
- Run autogen.sh, configure, and 'make dist'
- Run 'make distcheck' to verify the distribution can be built from
  the tarball.

Notes About libweb100 Versioning
================================

    libweb100 is using the libtool library versioning system, which maps
at compile time onto UNIX library versioning semantics.  The algorithm
seems to be:

MAJOR NUMBER = LT_CURRENT - LT_AGE
MINOR_NUMBER = LT_AGE
MICRO_NUMBER = LT_REVISION

    This seems to work quite well except for the occasional multiple
major number jump when interfaces are removed.

Notes About Man Page Generation
===============================

    The libweb100 API's man pages are generated by the 'doctext' program
from inline comments within the source code.  This is done when the
release coordinator runs 'make dist'.  Therefore, if you are a developer
and you are working out of the source tree, these pages will never be
generated and installed for you.
